		<h2>Amaren Read</h2>
		<p>Hello everybody, my name is Amaren (A.J.) Read, and I have been a online student here at Full Sail for a little over a year now.
			When I started, I did not know what to expect but the more I learned, the more I realized that I am on the right track in succeeding in
			my educational journey. I am 32 years old and currently living in Colorado. I am going for my bachelors degree in web design and development.
			I love learning and expanding my future goals with any positive educational experience I come in contact with. I am hoping to use what I have
			learned here at Full Sail to become a in home web designer/developer for myself or for a large company such as Google.</p><br><p>What I have learned so
		has really helped more understand a more in depth understanding of what it takes to become a professional and reliable web designer/developer.
		I like to watch movies, mainly comedy or martial arts, and I like to play video games on my down time. After I graduate, I plan on making a name
		for myself in the web designer/developer industry but I also plan on getting my masters degree in video game design. I am all for school and
		learning different ways of learning, there are a number ways of doing things and I believe everybody has potential to educate themselves through
		school or self teaching through school, others, or online articles.</p>

				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>For this composition the target audience of this site would be people in the industrial field. The location of such industries are located in high populated
					areas or near mining sites, or where resources are more plentiful and mainly companies or people that work with equipment used in the industrial field. The field can consist
					of people(mainly men), between the ages of 20-50. While the age span is pretty broad, the 20 year olds are mostly the crew while the 50 year olds are mostly the
					owners or higher ups in the company.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The client goals for this site are people with a financial stability, have enough money to purchase such industrial equipment, or know how to operate
					industrial equipment and to give positive feedback to this company. People in the industrial field are either building or produce something for themselves
					using this companies products or services, or another company has hired them to build or produce something for them. The people who use the products or services
					of this company want information about the company to get a better understanding of the products and services they provide. The client would be somebody or
					a different company wanting something from this company that could provide such equipment for them.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>For this companies header, I notice that the "phone" and "location" text and icons could be a different color due to it is kind of hard to see with the grey
					background color. The logo text could be in a different font family for those who do not know how to read cursive. The light blue in the text signifies stability,
					trust, wisdom, loyalty, faith, truth, intelligence, and confidence to the users. The use of the orange in the navigational tags and the search icon helps symbolize
					a sense of strength, happiness, joy, and determination to the users. The black background with the white navigational text sends the message of power with a touch of purity.</p>

		<h2>CTA</h2><a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54627.html" target="_blank">
		<img src="images/compImage2.png"></a>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The target audience for this composition would be anybody between the ages of 18 and up. I say 18 and up because most installation companies
					tend to make contracts for people to sign at the age of 18 or older. Gender could be both female or male. Location could be a residence or in
					a work place.  </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>For this CTA, the digital installation company has set up awareness of what exactly they do and how users can get more information by switching to digital
					or raise awareness by letting their users have additional information. The CTA looks professional and the client can use brand recognition from the image
					used in the CTA, letting their users find out what their product and services are by having a professional looking CTA. The users of digital installation
					want to have the best services for their viewing experience and this can be done by looking at the layout of the CTA. Users tend to trust a site that looks
					professional than sites that are dull or that lack specific information or no additional information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The use of the red buttons draws attention to people who view this website to attain more information about what this company does or what the benefits of digital
					viewing compared to different methods of viewing. The buttons used are sized proportionately for easy recognition and the red brings out what the company loves to
					do or provide for their users. The columns are laid out in a way for easy reading and the text pops out to the viewers due to the font size and font family usage.
					I like how they used the "W" is "Switch" to indicate two V's, with the first V switching over to the next V which helps the flow of eye movement over the text.
					The image used sends a clear message that the company is about digital viewing and the use of black and blue blends in together letting the viewers know that they
					are a formal and trustworthy company. Everything is aligned correctly and the use of the elements in the CTA are attention grabbing to those who view this CTA.</p>

		<h2>Features</h2>
		<a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54817.html" target="_blank">
			<img src="images/compImage3.png"></a>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The target audience for this composition would be people looking for roofing repairs on their homes or in the housing industry. Homeowners mainly range from 40 and up. Gender could
					be both male and female that own their own home or people in the housing industry. Location could be anywhere but mostly in high populated areas.  </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The client goals here would be somebody providing roofing materials and/or labor work and to provide services or roofing products to people who have a home, business, or housing complex.
					The user would be businesses, a home, or housing owners and the user needs would be people looking for products or repairing services to help them attract more people into buying a home,
					renting a place to stay, or renting a building for a business. The user would look at this website and see how professional it looks and be interested in hiring this company to repair their
					roof due to the look and feel of the site. Users could then let others know about this site in order to generate more people into looking at the site, and the more people who look at the site, would mean more people might be interested into purchasing
					the products or services the client has to offer. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The design of this composition is well laid out in terms of icon placement, column width and height. The icons symbolize settings, a chat feature, and a social networking icon or meet the team icon
					and they also have read more links to let the viewer know they can get more information about each individual feature. The yellow gives a sense of happiness, joy, and positivity this company has but
					it is also kind of bright and harsh on the eyes, maybe they could tone it down a little bit. The text is easy to read, it isn't to big or to small and the letter spacing is probably aligned with each
					of its titles and subtitles. The image indicates a soft red-ish brown, letting viewers know this company is about passion, happiness, and the company can be trusted. The blue of the image ties everything
					together by providing a feel of calmness and relaxation.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This composition is about a business/company who provide doors and windows to people who need a home, office, company, or business make over for their windows and doors. The target audience for this composition
					would be for any home, office, building, companies, or businesses. Gender could be both male or female who have the extra cash to spend on redecorating their windows or doors. Location could be in a place of business
					or residency. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The client goals are to promote their services and products by letting users know what they are about. In being successful, the client would get users to identify that they are there to provide door and window products
					or services. The client will help create a positive image for themselves within their community or abroad to other communities. The user viewing the material and/or services will most likely help spread the word by telling
					their friends or family, and then they will tell others as well due to the information they have gathered from this companies about section.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I could not wait to get to this part for this composition because of the colors being used. I love how they used the Earth toned brown to help create a sense of energy and smoothness of the about section.
					not only did they use the brown on the circle tabs but they also put it into the main heading title which helps create a flow throughout the page. I do as well like how they used the rule of thirds in the
					placement of their columns. The text is very easy to read against the purity of the white background and it fits perfectly for this about section. The footer and heading horizontal rules match perfectly with
					the layout of this about section because of the flower type shape in the middle of the horizontal rule which makes it feel more down to Earth and peaceful.</p>

		<h2>Testimonials</h2>
		<a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/54618.html" target="_blank">
			<img src="images/compImage5.png"></a>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This composition is from a company that appraises homes. The target market would be home owners at a age range of 50-70. The gender could be both female or male and to those who own their own home. The location would
					be mainly in high populate cities or some in rural areas.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The clients' goal of using this testimonial section would be to give their users or interested users, a base of establishment from other users who have contacted them for their services before. The user needs are to find
					out if this company would be the best choice to appraise the users home(s). The client goals are also to increase capitol and generate a user friendly atmosphere within their community or other communities as well. The
					client tends to reach out and spread the word using the testimonial section as a way of communicating positive feed back to increase the awareness of what their company does and provide potential users to contact them
					for their appraisal needs.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>For this testimonial section it is pretty bland and basic due to a couple of things. First when viewing this section I spotted the image right away and it seems like to me the guy in the picture seems dissatisfied and
					has a "I guess" type of look on his face. Second, there is really no color except the dot tab at the bottom symbolizing that the viewer is on the first testimonial and sure the green tab is very useful but that is really
					the only color that pops out. The over all text is fine and aligned correctly and can be read with a flow and the white background does represent purity but the design is poor. If I were to make this design I would add a
					different picture, put it on the right hand side with a drop shadow of a orange tint or yellow tint to give it some character, and have the testimonial paragraph on the left hand side. By the way it it is now the picture
					discourages me to read the paragraph all together. I would also change the green dot tab to a semi dark blue color to help it blend in with the grey dot tab circle.</p>

				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This composition is for a consulting agency for businesses. The target audience would be for both female or male and the age range would be mainly 18 years of age or older. The age group would mostly be people who have a
					high understanding of business skills but need help with the consulting process. Location could vary from large, to small cities, or even country areas.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The client goals for this composition is to help users contact them if they need any consulting done for their business or businesses. If the client is interested in what the user has sent, which most likely they will be in
					order to generate capitol, they would contact the user via the information the user has provided. The user needs are to know how accredited this consulting agency is and where they are located as well. The user would need
					to know the location in order to have a face-to-face interview or to ask additional questions about their needs or about the agency itself.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>When I first looked at this contact form my eyes went straight to the "Clear" and "Send" buttons which have a red-ish orange color to them which symbolizes strength, power, determination with happiness and sunshine. This is a
					pretty simple form layout but has a lot of meaning behind it. IT is not confusing for the viewers to input their name, E-mail, phone number and message that needs to be sent but it also has a place on the left hand side that
					has additional information for the viewers. This information could consist of who would be getting the messages and viewer information or when the person getting said information would be getting back to them, or office hours etc.
					I do like how they have at the lower left hand corner a place for the company name and additional information about where the company is located and how to contact them in a different way. The grid structure is well aligned and
					the text is easy to read. The use of color with the white background signifies cleanliness, goodness and safety. All around this is a very professional looking contact form.</p>

			<li>
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This is a Login/Registration form for a organic cosmetics store. The target audience for this store are mainly females between the ages of 20-40. There are some men's products here as well but the target audience mainly focuses on women.
					The location is internet based and stores like these are commonly referred to as web stores.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Having a web based store is trending and one of the most efficient ways of generating revenue due to the technological advancements that we have today. The user needs here are the organic products that are offered by this store. The client
					goals are to provide the users with a way to login or register, so that the users have an account to order the products, see what products they wish to order, or to keep track of which products they already have ordered. The users can they
					order the same products again or try out different products. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>When I first looked at this login/registration form, I noticed the very harsh color of the lime green for the buttons. Yeah, it stands out but it is very harsh on the eyes. They have the right colors for the buttons to give the viewer a sense
					of harmony and growth but they need to change it to a darker green maybe a green like they have on the "Forgot Password" link. The column alignment is good and has an easy flow to it from left to right and the text usage is somewhat easy to
					read but I think they need to change the grey-ish text color to a much darker color such as black or maybe a dark green. The icons are also somewhat hard to see as well. The background gives off a sense of purity and cleanliness but with the
					light text and icon colors, it is difficult to understand what messages the designer/developer is trying to convey to the viewers.</p>

				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This composition is for the team of dentists who do cosmetic dentistry. The target audience would be both female and male with the age range of 30 and up, due to the financial nature of high cost cosmetic dentistry. They are looking for individuals
					who are financially stable and who have knowledge of what cosmetic dentistry cost. Location would probably be in cities that have middle to high class individuals.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The user needs would be services that provide dentistry with what they pay for and the client goals are to deliver such needs to the users. The user would get as much information as possible from the client or from positive feedback in order to see if
					this client is the right choice for the user to go to. The client would most likely give the user a estimated cost of how much it would be for a specific procedure(s) and the user would then have the option to go through with the procedure or seek a
					different route or another option from the client.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>In the images, all of the team looks professional and seem to have a high degree of knowledge of what they are doing. Their smiles indicate a sense of friendship and to show that they are trustworthy. The grid system is horizontally and vertically aligned
					and proportionate and the color of the green text symbolizes growth and harmony. The letter spacing is very well adjusted and the font family used is easy to read. The black on white background symbolizes mystery with faith. Over all, this composition of
					team looks very professional and trustworthy.</p>

				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This is a gallery for a fueling station that uses alternative fuels for "Go Green" type of vehicles. The target audience would be the genders of both male and female with and age range of 40-70 and who have some knowledge of alternative fuels and have the money
					to buy such a vehicle and/or alternative fuels. The location could be anywhere but mostly where alternative fuels are most resourceful. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The client goals here are to provide the users with a alternate source of fuel for the specific type of advanced vehicle the users are using. The client goals are to generate revenue and to give a high rated type of customer service to their users. The user needs
					are to have a alternative source of fuel, seek resourceful information and to see what options they have when using such alternative fuel sources.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The heading at the top of the gallery section has a font family that symbolizes a bold way of using alternative fuels and it is easy to read due to the letter spacing and the font weight of the typography. In the first image, when the viewer hover over the images,
					the "read more" text turns yellow which gives the viewer a sense of joy, happiness and intellect. Even though the words blend into the corn image, it is nice and very professional looking because of the message it sends out due to the yellow color. The text headings
					within the images symbolize goodness, cleanliness and safety.The icons used under the "read more" link are centered in place. The grid system used is properly aligned with the cross spacing between the images. This is a very perfect gallery section that looks very
					professional and the use of green in all the images represent nature, fertility, and harmony.</p>

				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This composition is for a company called "Globy" who provide technology solutions for businesses and organizations. Target audience would be both male and female in the age range of 18-30 because of copyright a legality issues when working with another company for technological
					reasons. The target audience are also the individuals who have knowledge in the business and organizational fields. Location would most likely be in middle to large cities due to the more populated areas mean more people looking to start their own businesses or organizations.</p>

					goals are to provide to the user needs of taking action on said solutions. The client could help generate revenue from other businesses by having positive feedback from the businesses or organizations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The background has a strong symbolization of formality, elegance, and power that blends in with the purity of white on the text headers. The boldness of the headings is easy to read and the sub text has the blue tint which symbolizes stability, trust, and confidence. The "Globy"
					copyright and "Privacy Policy" at the bottom left is unique because on most sites, that element is usually centered, but in this case it is unique with character. </p>
